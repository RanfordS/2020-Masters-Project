wiki summary (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)

computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
image recognition
	large set of manually labeled data
	no prior knowledge of what constitutes the label
	auto' generates identifying characteristics from data
collection of connected artificial neurons (nodes)
	receive signal from previous layer (edges)
	take weighted sum with bias
	non-linear function
	output new signal to next layer
applications
	computer vision
	speech recognition
	machine translation
	social network filtering
	playing games
	medical diagnosis
