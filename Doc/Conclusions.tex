\chapter{Conclusions}

Neural networks have a wide range of applications, and TensorFlow provides an
easy-to-use framework for defining and training models for image recognition and
curve fitting within python, via the Keras sub module.

One major difficulty with TensorFlow is that, when attempting to search for
informational resources regarding custom TensorFlow models (as would have been
required for implementing policy gradients), a large number of the results were
for TensorFlow 1, not TensorFlow 2, and the difference between the versions is
substantial.
Had more time been available, a more thorough understanding of TensorFlow's
lower level functions and classes may have been possible.

A point of interest for further research maybe a comparison between TensorFlow 2
and other neural network packages, such as PyTorch, with respect to performance
and ease of use.
