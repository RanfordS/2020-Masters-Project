\chapter*{Abstract}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) still remains as one of the greatest challenges in
scientific research to this date, but much progress in the field has been made
using artificial neural networks.
The design of artificial neural networks is loosely inspired by that of
biological brains, and serves as an expansion of an earlier concept called the
perceptron \citep{Rosenblatt:1958:Perceptron}.
By using multiple layers of these artificial neurons, we can form a highly
connected system that is referred to as a neural network,
these networks can then be trained on a large data set to predict the output
with high accuracy.

The range applications for neural networks is wide: they can be used to classify
data, predict future states of chaotic systems, apply stylisations to images,
and control physical/physically-based system in real-time.
