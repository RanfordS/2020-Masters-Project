\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to give special thanks to two people.

My project supervisor, Dr Stephen Lynch, for his insight and guidance throughout
the project, particularly during the early stages writing and research.
Your advice helped shape and direct the project, and it would not be the same
without it.

And my good friend, Francesca Merritt, for her late-stage proofreading and
feedback.
The small issues you noted were of great importance to me, and your generously
given time was greatly appreciated.
