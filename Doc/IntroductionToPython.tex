\chapter{Neural Networks in Python}

Python is a general-purpose programming language designed by Guido van Rossum,
with an emphasis on readability and reusability \citep{vanRossum:1996:foreword}.
It comes with an extensive standard library and is one of the most popular
programming languages.

There are multiple options for interacting with Python, these include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item typing commands into an interpreter,
    \item writing files and running them with an interpreter,
    \item using an online service such as Google Colab.
\end{itemize}
