\section*{Project title}
Neural Networks with Python and TensorFlow

\section*{Stakeholders}
Alexander James Johnson (Student),\\
Dr Stephen Lynch (Project supervisor).

\section*{Project Background}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at the forefront of scientific research.


Agent based modelling is a simulation approach where autonomous units, called agents, use simple rules to interact with the environment and one another to produce complex behaviours.
Because there is no single decision maker, it forms a useful basis for investigating crowd dynamics as the way that agents operate is analogous to that of real life problems; for instance, the formation of a school of fish is not organised, but is maintained by a common set of rules that allow it to act as a single unit.\\
Similar rules can be applied to create crowds that exhibit independence on the level of the individual agent, yet produce group behaviours such as flow.
As noted by \citet{Macal:2010}, agent based models have a diverse array of applications such as emulating stock markets and immune systems.

\section*{Aims}
Produce a neural network model to reliably solve an advanced problem,
potentially related to robotics.

\section*{Objectives}
Listed here are a set of objectives, and a suggested date for their completion
given as [year/month/day].

    \item Terms of reference submission. [2020/02/01]

    \item Use TensorFlow to produce results, giving a brief overview of how the
        TensorFlow library works, and how to use it. [2020/02/15]

    \item Background of a more advanced subject that will be the main focus of
        the report. [2020/03/10]

    \item Precursory results from own research. [2020/03/20]

    \item Preliminary report submission. [2020/03/27]

    \item Obtain sufficient results for own research. [2020/04/15]

    \item Completed own research, ready to begin final tweaks. [2020/05/10]

    \item Oral and poster presentations. [2020/05/21]

    \item Project submission. [2020/05/26]
\end{itemize}

\section*{Project Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A selection of programs that perform the calculations.

    \item A report, providing details of the mathematics and methodologies used.

    \item An interim report, which will act as a self contained sample of the
        full report.

    \item A poster presentation, highlighting key aspects of the project and
        displaying relevant results.

    \item An oral presentation, providing an in-depth overview of the report.

    \item The Terms of Reference, describing the scope and purpose of the
        project (this document).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Required Resources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Access to hardware capable of running Python and TensorFlow.

    \item Access to library and internet resources, for research purposes.

    \item An implementation of \LaTeX, for report writing.
\end{itemize}
All of the above requirements are already satisfied by the University or
otherwise.
